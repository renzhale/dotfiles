# FCA Repurchase Experience

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing you to commend Cynthia Tarlo and inform you of the excellent positive experience my wife and I had while dealing with the unfortunate circumstance of having our vehicle repurchased.

We recently found ourselves in a particularly uncomfortable and disheartening situation. Four months (and 3300 miles) after buying a new Jeep Wrangler it had a catastrophic engine failure rendering the car inoperable. After considerable diagnostics by the dealership and Chrysler engineers it was decided we would exercise our option to have the vehcile repurchased.

Shortly after contacting Jeep Customer Service, we met Adrian. Adrian was outstanding! He was professional, courteous and competent. He helped us by communicating our options and making us feel comfortable when we asked so many questions and wanted to discuss everything about the process of each option. He convinced us he was genuinly interested in helping us resolve our problem.

When we opted for the repurchase, we were contacted by Cynthia. She was, in a word, exceptional.

From the begining she was courteous and so confident it eased any concerns of the handling of our case. She was infomative and once again, patient with all of our questions and concerns. Her professionalism was matched with a genuine demeanor that came through while working with her. She was consistant and diligent. She had integrity which I rarly see any more. It's a lost ethic that honestly is extremely important to me.

It is manifested in small gestures. She returned phone calls when she said she would. She would email when she said she would. She would take care of actions on her part when she said she would. In a time when customer service is on the decline, Cynthia conducted herself to redifining the term. Simply stated, she made our experience with FCA an exceptional one. We've heard all the horror stories of people dealing with issues with car manufacturers. I'm happy to say, we don't know what that's like.

In closing, we'd like to thank Cynthia for all her work and for making our negative issue such a positive experience! We also want to wish her all the success and happiness, but I don't think she'll have any problem with that. She already has the formula.

Sincerely,

Lorenzo & Kerry Hale
