# FCA Repurchase Experience

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing you to commend Cynthia Tarlo and inform you of the excellent positive experience my wife and I had while dealing with the unfortunate circumstance of having our vehicle repurchased.

We recently found ourselves in a particularly uncomfortable and disheartening situation. A brand new Jeep Wrangler we purchased had a catastrophic engine failure rendering the car inoperable. After considerable diagnostics by the dealership and Chrysler engineers it was decided we would exercise our option to have the vehcile repurchased.
